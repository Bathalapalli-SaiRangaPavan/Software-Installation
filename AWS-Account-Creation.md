- You need to enter your Credit Card details.
- However, donâ€™t worry. This will not charge anything from your account (except for a verification amount that will be refunded back). But this is required in case you exceed the free-tier limit available with a new AWS Account.

- Unless you are planning to do some professional development, i would suggest selecting the Basic Plan. It is Free of cost and great for learning purposes.
- Once you select your plan, you will see the below Welcome screen. From here on, you can Sign in to your AWS Console. Here, you also have the option of personalizing your experience of using Amazon Web Services.
